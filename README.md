# SECTION 1 : PROJECT TITLE
### SIT UP STRAIGHT, a real-time posture detector

# SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
In this project, the team successfully built a system to detect improper seating posture using a common computer webcam. This system relies on open-source algorithms such as face detection, facial landmarks and OpenPose body estimation. It visualizes the output in the form of a visual traffic light and provides real-time feedback for the user to adjust his/ her posture. The system has been evaluated and works well in various experimental environments.
